# Hi!

- First year Computer Science @ UNSW, Australia

As one can see, I have yet to publish any notable projects to my lack of experience and skills, however, I will someday... 😁

Most of the public repositories (if they are visible) are primarily from when I started to learn how to code, hence the visible lack of skill...
I shall continue to create public repositories when I have the time to! 😁
